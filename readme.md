# Autonomous Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A) in Python

This repository provides a comprehensive framework, guide, and practical examples for building autonomous agents (A2A) that communicate, learn, and interact using Python. It covers fundamental agent concepts, architectures, implementation details, and a working protocol for agent-to-agent (A2A) communication leveraging modern Python tools and reinforcement learning.

## Introduction

Autonomous agents are software entities capable of perceiving their environment, reasoning about goals, and acting to achieve them without direct human intervention. This repository explores the principles and implementation of such agents, focusing on agent-to-agent communication and reinforcement learning for adaptive behaviors.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Perception:** Gathering information from the environment (e.g., position, velocity, emotion).
- **Reasoning:** Making decisions, planning, and learning from experience.
- **Action:** Interacting with the environment or other agents.
- **Goals:** Objectives that the agent strives to achieve.
- **Environment:** The context in which agents operate and interact, including other agents.

---

## Agent Architectures

The repository explores and demonstrates several agent architectures:

- **Reactive Agents:** Respond directly to sensory input.
- **Deliberative Agents:** Use planning and reasoning for goal achievement.
- **Hybrid Agents:** Combine reactive and deliberative components.
- **Utility-Based Agents:** Make decisions to maximize expected utility.
- **Learning Agents:** Improve performance over time via experience and feedback.

---

## System Overview

This repo implements a practical A2A protocol, combining a FastAPI-based communication server and Python-based agent clients:

- **A2A Communication Server (`a2a_server.py`):**
  - Handles agent registration, WebSocket communication, message queues, and reinforcement learning via Q-learning.
  - Manages agent sessions, tracks state, and provides direct and asynchronous agent-to-agent messaging.

- **Agent Implementation Example (`agent_a.py`):**
  - Demonstrates a Python agent that connects to the server, sends observations, receives actions, and provides reward feedback.
  - Implements state and action history tracking, feedback heuristics, and performance analysis.

---

## Implementation Details

### A2A Communication Server

- **Tech Stack:** FastAPI, WebSockets, CORS, Pydantic, NumPy, MessagePack, asyncio.
- **Features:**
  - **Agent Registration:** `/register` endpoint for agents to obtain session IDs.
  - **WebSocket Endpoint:** `/ws/{session_id}` for real-time agent communication.
  - **Reinforcement Learning:** Simple Q-learning model for each agent, learning optimal actions based on rewards.
  - **Agent Messaging:** Supports both direct and queued messages between agents.
  - **Feedback Processing:** `/feedback` endpoint for agents to send reinforcement rewards.

### Agent Example: `agent_a.py`

- **Tech Stack:** asyncio, websockets, msgpack, requests, NumPy.
- **Features:**
  - **Registration:** Registers itself with the server and obtains a session ID.
  - **Observation Loop:** Periodically sends its state (position, velocity, emotion) to the server.
  - **Receives Actions:** Waits for server responses indicating which action to take.
  - **Sends Feedback:** Provides reward feedback to the server for reinforcement learning.
  - **Performance Analysis:** Tracks and analyzes action and reward history.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Install required packages:
  ```
  pip install fastapi uvicorn websockets msgpack numpy pydantic requests
  ```

### Running the Server

1. Start the A2A server:
   ```
   uvicorn a2a_server:app --reload
   ```

### Running an Example Agent

1. In a separate terminal, run the agent:
   ```
   python agent_a.py
   ```

2. The agent will:
   - Register with the server
   - Connect via WebSocket
   - Send observations
   - Receive suggested actions
   - Provide reward feedback to improve the server-side RL policy

- **Visualization:** Real-time dashboards for monitoring agent interactions and learning.
- **Extensible Protocol:** Support for encrypted messages, agent authentication, and richer agent metadata.
- **Documentation Expansion:** Full API docs, example notebooks, and tutorials.
- **Benchmarking:** Performance and scalability metrics for agent communication.
- **Testing Framework:** Automated tests for server and agent logic.
